# Dlib_Face_Detection_Demo
A dlib face detection demo

What the code does is simply detect faces from the build-in test image and print the time cost on the screen.

This is multi-platform sample code for both Android and iOS. Code is written in QT. So first of all, you should have a QT development environment.
